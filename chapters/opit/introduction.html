<p>OPit Lan for Windows is a C++ library which allows for a Windows device (PC, laptop) to
    send commands (Payment Request, Settlement, Reports etc) to an Odero Pos terminal.<br/>
    The communication between the two devices is performed through TCP/IP sockets.<br/>
    Both devices have to be connected to the same router / wifi network.</p>

<p>Please follow the below instructions for setup:<br/>
<ol type="1">
    <li>To use OPIT Lan you will need to use static ips for both devices, on the client
        tablet and the Odero POS terminal, and to have a dedicated router with - potentially
        - DHCP off (depends on the router)<br/>
        Tutorial on how to set up static ip on Windows can be found <a
                href="https://pureinfotech.com/set-static-ip-address-windows-10">here</a>
    </li>
    <li>Connect to wifi on the dedicated router on both devices.</li>
    <li>The Odero POS terminal must have the ip 192.168.1.1 this is the ip where the client
        device expects to find the host.
    </li>
    <li>Install app-lan-host-release.apk on the Odero POS terminal and OpitDesktopSampleApp
        on the Windows device.
    </li>
    <li>Start the OPIT Lan app on the Odero POS terminal.</li>
    <li>Start Sample app on windows.</li>
    <li>Send payment request.</li>
</ol>

<ol type="1">
    <li>OPit lan host on Odero POS terminal is started and the socket server is booted up.
    </li>
    <li>Client app (that implement OPit library) starts on windows device and connects to
        the socket server from the Odero POS terminal.
    </li>
    <li>Client app receives onConnected callback.</li>
    <li>Client app sends payment request via opened tcp/ip socket and is received on the
        Odero POS terminal.
    </li>
    <li>Client app terminates the socket connection.</li>
    <li>Client app receives onDisconnected callback.</li>
    <li>Odero POS terminal switchs from wifi to gsm data as required by the bank app in
        order to perform the transaction on secure connection. Also the host socket server
        is shut down.
    </li>
    <li>Odero POS terminal host awaits for response from the bank app.</li>
    <li>Client app sends connnection ping requests attempting to connect to the socket
        server on the host device. These attempts fail at this point because the socket
        server is shut down as described in previous step.
    </li>
    <li>Host app receives response from the bank app, network switch from gsm to wifi occurs
        and the socket server is started.
    </li>
    <li>Client app connection request is successful.</li>
    <li>Host app on Odero POS terminal sends the response from the bank app and is received
        on the client app (windows)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The client app side implementation is rather simple, only step 4 is required to be
    perfomed, all other steps on the client side are performed under the hood inside the
    library.</p>
