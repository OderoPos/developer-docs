<h3>Opit Bluetooth</h3>

<p>
    This version of OPIT project is designed to work with Odero POS terminals that have
    Bluetooth connectivity. The communication between the Android device and the Odero POS
    terminal is facilitated through Bluetooth, enabling seamless data exchange between the
    two devices. OPIT Bluetooth provides developers with a reliable and secure channel for
    sending commands such as Payment Requests, Settlements, Reports, and more, directly to
    the Odero POS terminal. By leveraging this powerful toolkit, developers can create
    custom workflows, tailor the user experience, and incorporate Odero POS functionality
    seamlessly into their existing applications.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    To use OPIT Bluetooth, developers need to ensure that the Odero POS terminal has the
    host app installed. The host app is responsible for establishing a Bluetooth connection
    with the Android device and handling the communication between the two devices. Once the
    connection is established, developers can send commands from their Android applications
    to the Odero POS terminal, enabling real-time, bidirectional communication over
    Bluetooth.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    If you want to use OPIT Bluetooth, you need to follow the below steps:<br/>
</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Install the host app on the Odero POS terminal.</li>
    <li>
        Implement the OPIT client libraries in your Android application. In this step, you
        will integrate the OPIT Bluetooth libraries into your Android project to enable
        communication with the Odero POS terminal.
        <p>
            <br> You need to add the following dependencies to your build.gradle files
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Init the Opit object in your Android application. The Opit object is responsible for
        establishing a Bluetooth connection with the Odero POS terminal and sending commands
        to the terminal.
    </li>
    <li>Send commands from your Android application to the Odero POS terminal using the Opit
        object.
    </li>
</ol>
